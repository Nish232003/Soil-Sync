## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a local copy of the project up and running.

### Prerequisites

You need to have Python and pip installed on your machine.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/Nish232003/Soil-Sync.git](https://github.com/Nish232003/Soil-Sync.git)
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```sh
    cd Soil-Sync
    ```

3.  **Install the required dependencies:**
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Run the main analysis script or notebook:**
    ```sh
    jupyter notebook
    ```

5.  **Open the main notebook** to see the data processing, model training, and visualizations.

## üß† How It Works

The core of SOIL SYNC is a machine learning pipeline that ingests and processes IoT sensor data. It utilizes various classification models, such as **Logistic Regression** and **Random Forest**, to classify the soil's fertility status based on key chemical and physical properties[cite: 17]. The results are then presented on a clear and intuitive dashboard.
